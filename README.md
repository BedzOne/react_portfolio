# react_portfolio
Portfolio React

/First Draft/

This is my second attempt at my portfolio website. I created using 

- React
- React-Router
- SASS

I used webpack for configuring and compiling my project.

Still to be added:

- animations (component animations and HTML elements animations)
- attach validation to contact form
- upload different images
- change layout of about page
- add more photos to work section and add slider to each project
